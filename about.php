    <div class="History">
        <p>
            Apostle Fred Stephen Safo was a prominent figure in the Church of Pentecost.
            Born on November 6, 1932, in Obo-Kwahu, Eastern Region of Ghana, he was educated
            at the English Church Mission School and pursued further studies independently. He
            took leadership courses at The Haggai Institute in Singapore and attended a program
            by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Ministry in Amsterdam in 1986.
            Apostle Safo accepted Christ in 1948 and entered full-time ministry in 1952 at just
            20 years old. He married Beatrice Adjabeng in 1957, and their wedding was officiated
            by Reverend James McKeown, the founder of the Church of Pentecost. He was known for
            his wisdom, punctuality, and dedication, making significant contributions to the
            church's growth and administration.
            He served as the first African Chairman of the Church of Pentecost,
            succeeding its founder. His tenure saw the establishment and strengthening of
            various church initiatives, including media outreach through the creation of PENT TV.
            Apostle Safo's legacy is honored through several church buildings and initiatives named after him,
            reflecting his lasting impact on the church and its communityâ€‹
